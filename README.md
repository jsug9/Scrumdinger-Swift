# Scrumdinger App

> Many software engineering teams use daily meetings, known as scrums, to plan their work for the day. To help keep scrums short and focused, Scrumdinger uses visual and audio cues to indicate when and how long each attendee should speak. The app also displays a progress screen that shows the time remaining in the meeting and creates a transcript that users can refer to later.
